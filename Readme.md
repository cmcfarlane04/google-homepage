This is the readme for my html project for TOP 
2/13/20 
    So first night working on the project 
    Got the logo and search bar in. Getting the header in as well
        For the header, decided to split it into two different div. We'll see how it works 

2/16/20 
    Started CSS 
    Added Header and Footer 
    Running into problems having header and footer all inline
        might need to do away with separate div for right and left and do css in the html code
